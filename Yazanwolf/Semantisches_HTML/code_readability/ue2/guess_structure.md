I tried to figure out the h1 to h6 hierarchy of this Website:
https://developerchandan.medium.com/top-10-blogs-every-beginner-developer-should-follow-to-accelerate-learning-a0d5c2b7b15c

My guess:

# h1: Top 10 Blogs Every Beginner Developer Should Follow to Accelerate Learning

# h6: Introduction

# h3: 1. FreeCodeCamp

# h5: Overview:

# h5: Why Follow:

# h3: 2. CSS-Tricks

# Overview:

etc.

In Code:

# h1: Top 10 Blogs Every Beginner Developer Should Follow to Accelerate Learning

# p -> strong: Introduction

it could be an h2 as it is a subtitle and an intruduction for the article.

# h1: 1. FreeCodeCamp

h1 should only be used once in a Site. Better h3 as it is an item in a list.

# p -> strong: Overview:

Could better be an h4 as it is a section of the described object "FreeCodeCamp".

# p -> string: Why Follow:

Could better be an h4 as it is a section of the described object "FreeCodeCamp".

etc.
