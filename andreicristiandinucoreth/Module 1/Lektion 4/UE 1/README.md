# UE1 - Fokusreihenfolge

For this exercise I looke at https://eviden.com/ and tried navigating with tab.
Most of the website deals with this navigation correctly, besides one small issue. The carrousel at the top of the page has on the second slide a "Learn More" link. While navigating between the two slides of the carrousel is possible, it is very hard to get the focus on the "Learn More" link, as it exists before the carrousel navigation, and the button is only focusable if that slide is currently in view.

This can be improved by using the behaviour that the other carrousel at the bottom of the page uses ("Lates Press Release"), where tab navigation cycles you through the "Read More" link in each card, making it very easy to access those links.
