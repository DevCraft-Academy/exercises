# UE 2 - Collaboration to clarify requirements

## User Story

| As a shopper, I want to search for products by category so I can quickly find items that match my interests.

## Questions to clarify with stakeholder:
- What should be the available categories to be shown to the User?
- Should it be possible to have more than one category selected at once?
- What should be the default selection for the category search?
- What should determine the ordering of the items shown by the search?
- Should there be a button for the User to clear all selected filters?
- Should there be more search filters/criterias other than the category? (Maybe some that are category specific)
